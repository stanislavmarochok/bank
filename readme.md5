This repository contains server-client application, which I called ZZZ Bank.

API has a Swagger documentation on address /api/documentation

Server side, API, is made with Laravel framework. I have used a JWT token for authorization.
User have to register, then sign in using his credentials, then he gets an access token.

Required parameters for registration are: username, email, first_name, last_name, password, password_confirmation.
Required parameters for authentication are: email, password.

Client side, Windows application, is made in WPF, C# framework. There is an MVVM design pattern implemented, program saves user's access token so he will not need to sign in again, until token expiration.

There are several things you have to change in files to test the project:
 1. In file api/.env - write credentials to connect to your database, I am connection to my local database.
 2. In file client/wpf_client/Utils/HTTPConnectionBase.cs - change request base address to the one you need, pr leave the same...

How to start the project:
 (!!! You have to have PHP, Composer, MySQL installed, I have PHP 7.4)
 1. Clone the whole repository to your local directory.
 2. Open folder "api" in command line
 3. Execute command "php artisan db:create" - it will create a database "bank" in your SQL client
 4. Execute command "php artisan migrate" - it will create all the neccesary tables in the database
 5. Execute command "php artisan serve" - it will run the API on localhost:8000
 6. Open folder "client/wpf_client/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1" and run file "wpf_client.exe"
 7. Enjoy
