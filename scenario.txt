HI
Let's create some shitttt.
What's about PHP Laravel for API, and C# WPF for client?

API:
 - register user
 - authorize user
 - basic bank payment methods
   - get money
   - put money
   - some other shit i don't know, we will add new points during the work
   
Client:
 - authorize
 - register
 - basic bank operations
 
I already have Composer for Laravel, and Visual Studio for WPF.

I will copy codes from Stack Overflow :D

Let's begin...

//  Chapter 1 - the beginning //

1. Create GitHub repository - "BANK"
2. Create Laravel project - I don't remember how to do it :D
   1. Created folder inside another folder - I don't like it, let's move it up
   2. fuck, I broke it, let's create the whole project from the very beginning xD
   3. project created, let's run it up!
   4. started server on localhost:8000 - it works lol xD
   5. let's upload this to repository
   6. problem was with credentials - i had saved credentials from another github account
3. Let's create WPF app
   1. Project created - let's push it to the repository
